    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am a software engineer in the making and am practicing making websites. My inspiration for this project
        comes from my dog, Larry. He is the cuh-UTEST little dude. But don't take my word for it:</p>
    <img src="Larry9.jpg">
    <p>My goal is to make a few linked pages about Larry, starting at the beginning. Because where else?</p>

    <h2>The Prelude</h2>
    <p>I wanted a puppy ever since I learned what puppies are. I relentlessly pestered my mom for one and she always
        said no (obviously trying to RUIN my LIFE-UH). Then, in 2011, two big life events were happening -- I was
        turning 18 and
        graduating from highschool in the same month. I figured this was my best opportunity; if I only asked for
        <em>one</em> thing for both occasions, there's no way my mom could say no. I even started <a href="#LarryName">
            talking about the
            puppy</a> as if she had said yes (which she refers to as my jedi mind trick). To my dismay, in April of 2011
        my mom
        got me a new phone and said it was a birthday present. While grateful for the phone, I was disappointed as this
        meant I would not be getting a puppy as a graduation+birthday gift. Ending on a cliffhanger, you say? Don't be
        silly, <a href="file:///C:/Users/ahola/AppAcademy-Projects/Larry-Website/page2.html">find out if
            I get the puppy or not!</a>
    </p>

    <h2 id="LarryName">The Jedi Mind Trick</h2>
    <p>The main thing that I did was pick Larry's name months before I got him. Funnily enough, the inspiration for his
        name came from CoD: Black Ops. We used to play games against the AI, and enemies were named after people on your
        friends list. When there were more AI in the game than friends on your list (always the case for me), the game
        would
        randomly generate a name. So when most enemies had names like "CompactSniper" and "ColonelPepper", there was one
        AI
        that was always named "Larry". Something about the name always hit my funny bone. Thus, during the waiting
        period
        between asking for a puppy and the month of June I would say things like "Larry's going to sleep in my room" and
        "I'm going to teach Larry so many cool tricks".</p>
