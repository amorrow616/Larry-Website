    <p>Sometimes, no matter how prepared and careful you think you are, it's simply not good enough. I truly wish Larry
        would not have to deal with the consequences of my mistakes, but he does. I've had him for almost 12 years now
        and he continues to amaze me with how brave he is both during and after a crisis. For example, in 2020 we were
        walking along a hiking path behind our apartment building. I'm originally from New York and was not familiar
        with the types of wildlife in North Carolina. I did not know to watch for snakes, or realize that I should
        research possible threats to Larry in a new state. He was going to pee on a tree that was covered by vines and
        leaves, and a snake jumped out and bit him.</p>

    <p>One thing I like about myself is my response to stressful events. Fury at myself for not knowing better was
        instantly present, however it was a tiny voice in the background. My mind went calm as soon as Larry yelped and
        jumped back and I saw the snake. I knew first I had to check if it got him or just startled him as it jumped
        out. He came to me as I knelt down and I asked "did it get you?" He held up his front right leg in response,
        more likely due to the pain than him understanding what I said. At that point I did not know what kind of snake
        it was, venemous or not, so I took a moment to step within a safe distance and zoom in to snap a picture of the
        snake (seen
        above). Remembering something about venom moving through your system faster if you move, I picked Larry up and
        ran with him back up the path to my car.</p>
    <p>A quick aside, I highly recommend making sure your phone is charged before going for a hike. As I got to the car
        my phone had less than 10% battery. Being new to the area, I had to use the GPS on my phone to get directions to
        the nearest emergency Vet Clinic. I was worried the whole time that my phone would die and I would be lost, with
        Larry in the backseat potentially slowly dying to vemon. Thankfully I made it before my phone died and Larry was
        able to be treated. You can see the bite on his leg below.</p>

    <p>I will be the first to say that I was lucky in that situation. I was lucky that my foolish ignorance did not cost
        Larry his life. I was lucky that my phone did not die. I was lucky that I had a loose enough knowledge of
        snakebites to do the right things. Most of all I was lucky that the snake did not use venom (or at least very
        little). For anyone wanting some resources on what to do in situations like this, there are links below.</p>
